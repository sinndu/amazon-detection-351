"First & most offensive: they reek of gasoline so if you are sensitive/allergic to petroleum products like I am you will want to pass on these.  Second: the phone adapter is useless as-is. Mine was not drilled far enough to be able to tighten it into place for my iPhone 12 max. It just slipped & slid all over. Stupid me putting the adapter together first without picking up the binoculars to smell them bc I wasted 15 minutes trying to figure out how to put the adapter together bc it does not come with instructions!  I had to come back here to the website which was a total pain. Third: the tripod is also useless. I would not trust the iOS to hold my $1600 phone nor even a Mattel Barbie for that matter. It’s just inefficient for the job imo.  Third: in order to try to give an honest review I did don gloves & eyewear to check the binoculars out.  They seemed average except for mine seemed to be missing about 10% of the film costing in the lower edge of one of the lenses which would have ruined every video & photograph unplanned to take so for me these are a very huge hard pass.  I expect the accessories that come with the main product to be as good or better than the product I’m buying. Otherwise I would just buy the product as a stand alone.  Sadly, I found a decent pair of binoculars last year with a much better quality phone adapter & tripod, but they had a defect too.  Guess I’m going to have to pay more.  Ugh.","Binoculars, 12x42 Binoculars for Adults, Binoculars for Hunting, Compact Binoculars with Tripod, Smartphone Adapter for Hunting, Bird Watching, Hiking, Traveling and Sports",3.0,1658185117948,AFKZENTNBQ7A7V7UXW5JJI6UGRYQ,B083NRGZMM,0

"I love these. They even come with a carry case and several sizes of ear bud inserts. Thank heaven!  I get ear pain from most, but the smallest buds fit great.  They also have a charger and all of it fits in the carry case. I just wish they came in more colors preferably something bright!  When I leave them on my nightstand it takes a while to figure out which of half a dozen black cables are the right ones. Even white would be ok as only my iPhone has a white cord.","Senso Bluetooth Headphones, Best Wireless Sports Earbuds w/Mic IPX7 Waterproof HD Stereo Sweatproof Earphones for Gym Running Workout Noise Cancelling Earphones Earbuds Noise Cancelling Headsets",5.0,1523093017534,AFKZENTNBQ7A7V7UXW5JJI6UGRYQ,B01G8JO5F2,0
"I was searching for a sturdy backpack for school that would allow me to carry my laptop as well as schoolbooks. After reading many of the reviews of this bag, I placed my order and crossed my fingers. I shouldn't have worried; it's a great bag! Solidly built and traveler-friendly with a ton of compartments for every little thing one might need to stow away. While this backpack is slightly larger than your average backpack, it is comfortable to wear trekking cross campus. Also, another aspect of this bag that I love is that it stands upright. I know that sounds kinda crazy, but I find it annoying when your backpack flops over next to your desk and stuff kind of just falls out, or if you need to grab something quickly out of the bag you have to awkwardly curl your body around the side of your chair and then on the way up, smash your head against the desk. So yeah, lazy girl (points to self) loves the convenience of a bag that stands upright for easy grabbage. I plan to travel with this backpack when I fly home this Christmas instead of bringing a bulky tote bag on the plane.","Targus Air Traveler Laptop Backpack, Professional Business Bag with TSA Security Checkpoint-Friendly, Durable Material, Multiple Accessory Pockets, Protective for 16-Inch Laptop, Black (TBB012US)",5.0,1290278495000,AGGZ357AO26RQZVRLGU4D4N52DZQ,B001OC5JKY,0

These are fantastic headphones and I love that i can have my cell phone plugged in at a central location in my house and walk around the house and still listen to music or my book. the range for me is about 30' and the headphones will disconnect if i go outside and then reconnect when i get close to my phone again. If my phone is in my pocket it will stay connected where ever i go. I love listening to things without being attached or tethered to my phone. It also makes it harder for my kids to pull the earphones out of my ears when there is no long cord attached to my phone. I love the 1 click pause feature so i can quickly pause what i am listening to talk to someone (i don't have to go find my phone and swipe and pause). They are comfortable and stay on really well for my ears. I have taken them running and they stayed on as well. I had an issue about 1 year after I bought the headphones and the customer service was wonderful and understanding. really great product and I will continue to purchase and recommend these to my friends.,"Otium Bluetooth Earbuds Wireless Headphones Bluetooth Headphones, Sports Earbuds, IPX7 Waterproof Stereo Earphones for Gym Running 15 Hours Playtime Sound Isolation Headsets",5.0,1541356831659,AGCI7FAH4GL5FI65HYLKWTMFZ2CQ,B09S6Y5BRG,0

Very sturdy and well made. My AirPods fit snugly into the case and the cases latching button is magnetic and closes easily and is very secure. The charging light is visible as there is an opening for it built into the case so you can see when it is light up red or green and the charging port is accessible so you don’t have to remove them to charge them. They clasp onto my purse sturdily and I have no worries about them becoming dislodged from my purse and getting lost. If you want to use a different clasp it’s interchangeable with one of your choosing of the same size. Great quality for a great price.

"Positives:<br />1. Sweat cleans off easy, not hard to install and the included eye cover is functional. I find it works better with my frankenquest adapters at holding things in place than the stock foam. It bounces on my face less ands doesn't require as much tension.<br />2. This does seem to work better at keeping my face cool that just the silicone covers for the stock foam.<br />Negatives:<br />1. There is still a bit of light bleed out the sides, but it's not bad unless you are in a really bright room and you can only tell in dark scenes. I have seen other adapters including side cushions to repair this issue.<br />2. The nose piece doesn't stay on well, and when it does it presses hard and leaves a mark on my nose. It's still rubber so it's not painful, but there has to be a better solution. Maybe cut it lower or make it a bit more flexible. If you remove it there is a lot of open area in your lower vision.<br /><br />Overall I recommend it over a silicone cover for the stock foam, but it has a lot of downfalls so I am sure this isn't the best option for a new face plate.",PU Leather Interfacial Foam Cover for Quest 2 (2 Different Size PU Foam Replacemnets) & TPU Support Bracket & Lens Cover,3.0,1613517249405,AEVPPTMG43C6GWSR7I2UGRQN7WFQ,B08TTVLTWT,0

"I was currently an Ipad 4 user, having owned an Ipad 3 previously as well. I thought I was sold on Apple until till I purchased my nephew a 7"" Kindle Fire HD for Christmas. When he opened the box and began to use it, I was mesmorized with the quality of the picture and the amazing sound. Being that I have been a Prime member for years, I began to consider purchasing one for myself so I could benefit from the free Kindle book loans and streaming videos. I purchased this 4G LTE 8.9"" version on the Kindle Fire HD and after having used it for several days now non-stop, I assure you that the Ipad is going into the closet (or will be made a gift to one of my neices shortly). I could not resist the $49.99 package for 250 mb a month for 12 months along with the $50 credit Amazon was doing as a promotion.

"Ok, so let me preface this by saying that when I was in my 20's I owned a great SLR camera and dragged it around with me everywhere. I even used to take a load of pictures at rock concerts, had interchangeable lenses, a variety of lenses... well, you get the 'picture'. I was a 'professional' amateur. Flash ahead to the 1990's and on, I have a family and start to look for new gadgets. I owned several point and click cameras over the past 20 years, concentrating mainly on small sizes and portability. I loved the fact that I could slip these cameras into my pockebook and pack up the kids to the park (without a huge camera bag). Unfortunately, the pictures were 'ok' but nothing like the quality I had when I owned the old fashioned SLR. Well, now that I am 50'ish and my kids are grown and gone, I figured I would treat myself to a new camera, in particular this Canon Rebel. All I can say is 'wow'! I love it, love it, love it. Having owned it for over a year now (bought it on Amazon but just never got around to writing a review), I have purchased several interchangeable lenses and even a separate flash (although it comes with it's own built in one, I prefer to control the flash myself). The Canon Rebel gives me the quality of the pictures I was used to and with the stabilization, my pictures come out clear and focused every time. I have even started going back to concerts (ok, so they are the same artists I was following when I was much younger) and I am feeling like a pro again. I have also gotten into wildlife and nature pictures and some of the pictures I have taken of flowers could match up with any professional photographer.

"PLEASE PLEASE, do not buy these cameras and the doorbell. I did not listen. Now I am not going to use a lot of big words to describe the problem. I am just going to tell you the truth. I am 70 years old and I purchased these cameras because I live alone and I wanted security. I am not secure and I do not feel secure. I purchased due to all the advertisements and because Shaq endorsed them. They do not work and the customer service really sucks. One day I was put on hold for 45 minutes then hung up on. The supervisors are no help at all. I purchased 3 floodlight cameras and 1 doorbell camera. They all are malfunctioning. The doorbell does not alert until the person is long gone. What is the purpose if the incident is over before you can even see it. Then you cannot even pull the incident up for about 4-5 minutes! You have to wait to see who was at your door and that's not safe. in 4-5 minutes someone could already be in your house!! I have horrible neighbors who are interfering with one of the floodlight cameras and literally making it go off every 1-3 minutes. I've called ring over 52 times since October of 2019. They cannot or will not resolve the issue, other than tell me the camera cannot be tampered with. I KNOW THAT IS NOT CORRECT! If you buy these cameras buy at your own risk. I am here to tell you that they do not work and customer service will not help you when they fail and they will fail!!!! Shame on you Shaq O' Neal. Shame on you Amazon for buying and selling this mess !!!!!!!  On my last recent call to Ring I was told that the cameras do not work in real time. The representatives say whatever they want to try and get you to hang up. I'm 70 not senile. Someone named Richmond told me that! The commercials show the people walking up, you activating the sound and talking to the person. One of My problems is the people are already gone before the camera actually activates.

It was between this, Yamaha 473 or 573 units or Pioneer 1122. I went w/ Harman Kardon based on reviews, price and expectations of use. I have a 7.2 system that can shake the house in the basement for sports, movies etc. Our LG 47LM8600 would be matched to the system and we realized we didn't need anything more than 5.1 for the Living Room based on setup downstairs and with our L/R being somewhat small and open to dining/kitchen this unit would be a good match.<br /><br />1.

RMA returned to Newegg and got different speakers to match receiver from Amazon. Polk Audio PSW505 Sub (which works great with the 1700's LFE sub Hookup), BIC Center channel to match my Axiom M2 Bookshelves I brought down from the loft game system and the two additional Polk Audio RM6750 satellites for the rears.  - H/K auto setup worked like a champ for surround sound, but for our setup I tweaked it a bit for the subwoofer. Easily done in manual mode.<br /><br />3. Setup the Panasonic 3D Blu Ray via HDMI - no issues, You can even match names to HDMI inputs on back so they match the buttons on remote.<br /><br />4. Setup DirecTV inputs (SAT/Cable) - no issues worked well and we can get 5.1 sound on channels that have it encoded.<br /><br />5. HDMI out to LG tv. didn't' realize doing this at first took away the TV's sound. Which is OK since receiver sounds better than plain tv. it just requires another remote to be used for the process. Later today I'll look at making either or both the DirecTV / Harman Kardon Remotes universal for the system and thus streamline the 4 remotes we have out.<br /><br />6.

"I've been trying to use the cube with DTVNow for a few months now and have reset to factory defaults, deinstalled app multiple times and still have the same issue, which is the video and audio will stutter when starting the app after being dormant overnight or idle for several hours.  If I restart the Fire Cube, the app will work ok.  It's never been as fast the Gen 2 FireTV box we had but I was willing to deal with that for the slick device control the Cube offered. Not being able to use my primary  TV streaming service is a show stopper. Shame as it could have been a great device, I suspect it's a processor and/or lack of memory issue, but not certain.

"Generally speaking, I like the cover.  I wish, though, that the corners were a bit deeper so they gripped the IPad better.  I think the corners should click in, that would mean they’re being held tight. But they don’t and the IPad can be released too easily.  Fortunately, I don’t have to carry my IPad around like  some people do for their job.  I use mine mostly at a table or desk.  I’m happy that this cover has 3 grooves (instead of the 2 that many covers offer) to hold the IPad at different angles while being worked on, but it would be nice if they were deeper because when working on the IPad when it’s in the vertical position, it sometimes slides out of the groove and slams down.","JYtrend Smart Case for iPad 2nd/ 3rd/4th Generation with Pencil Holder, Rotating Stand Magnetic Auto Wake Up/Sleep Cover for iPad 2/3/4 A1395 A1396 A1397 A1403 A1416 A1430 A1458 A1459 A1460 (Leopard)",3.0,1628227370852,AHHBXLYVZCDODBPA2NTPSACJD6CA,B08XLXS9P4,0
"For the most part, I'm happy with the cover.  The colors are nice, but the thing I like the most is that there are 3 grooves to stand up the IPad instead of the only 2 grooves many covers have.

It seems like they're not deep enough. Two corners  snap in, the other 2 don't grip at all.  I don't carry my IPad outside of my home so I'm not too worried about it falling out of the case, but I would feel that it might slip out of the cover if I needed to carry it around outside.",New iPad 9.7 inch Case 2018 2017/ iPad Air 2 Case - 360 Degree Rotating Stand Protective Cover Smart Case with Auto Sleep/Wake for Apple iPad 5th/6th Generation (Black),4.0,1611087079657,AHHBXLYVZCDODBPA2NTPSACJD6CA,B07YRPBMC8,0

The problem is that even after having it for a couple of months, reading and rereading the instruction book, I still can't program it to wake me, either by radio (which I prefer) or the buzzer.

"I was really hoping to love love this... and I do like it..<br />PROS<br />- Like having a third arm/hand<br />- holds in place you choose<br />- black or white color options  (I purchased black for husband and white for me)<br />- table clamp is easy to attach if you have a perfectly flat table (top and bottom) up to 2"" thick or so - using twisting tube attached to the base. -NOTE:  There is a ""con"" to this as well.<br />- The coil is very, very difficult to manipulate.  BUT it once you get it there, it stays exactly where you place it.<br />CONS<br />- the clamp is really really stiff and difficult to stretch enough to hold your phone or device.  If you have any strength issues, this might not be the best choice.  Also, they edges will pinch you if you accidentally get your fingers in the way of the spring loaded clips.<br />- The table clamp only works with tables that are flat on top and bottom.  The place I wanted to clamp on has a groove underneath and my husband had to make a wooden block of sorts for the table clamp to work.<br /><br />Overall, I like the stand - but the engineering that is required to make a strong, stable holder, also makes it difficult to use.

"I am going to provide a list of pros and cons... but to summarize, I am really disappointed.  The most disappointing thing... a HUGE BLACK box that you must use.  They ""say"" it can be flush mounted to the wall - but NOT without a giant black brick below it.  There are multiple photos in the ads of the TV ""in use"" but not a single one that shows that ugly black box!!!  Here are my thoughts...<br />PRO...  (and they are weak)<br />- A fairly good picture.<br />- Mediocre sound.<br />- The art option - which is also on the con - so it kinda wipes this one out. You chose a piece and it will stay on for up to 4 hours.  There is a setting to adjust 1, 2, 3 or 4 hours.<br />- The best ""pro""?  The white frame was easily installed (it has magnets- but the little plastic pieces to secure the outer plastic to the frame are SUPER hard to secure.  Good luck.  I have provided a large number of photos to show all that I am outlining.<br />- It's a smart TV - which means you can hook up to your wifi and watch your netflix, prime, hulu, disney+.... but I will say I had to login my ""samsung acct"" in order to ""load"" my Amazon prime.  Really?  Just more ways for Samsung to follow you - you have to agree to them tracking/tracing you.  GRRRR... I should move this to the con list... another pro/con that wipe each other out.<br />CONS....<br />- First and foremost - that UGLY black box.  Approximately 9""x4""x1 1/2"" .  You cannot use the tv without it.  The power cord plugs into it.  If you planned on flush mounting (which is included with the TV - the most complicated and awful install imaginable) you will have an ugly black box under the TV.<br />- We had to purchase an adjustable frame to mount to the wall in order to hide the black box behind it.  AND a white power cord so that the ""showing"" cord is at least white.  I may hire an electrician to put a plug in behind it but at this point you have to wonder how much more I will spend to make this work as the photos all show.  GRRRR<br />- The remote. Good luck getting the back open to put the batteries in!!  It doesn't just ""slide"" open as the only direction on this is printed on the remote - and arrow pointing to the end of the remote.  If you find yourself with one of these TVs - here's a hint... get a dime.  Gently work into the top where the red plastic (the infrared tip) and the white body of the remote... wiggle it - ever so gently - back and forth... We eventually got it open.  Sheesh.<br />- We attached the ugly black box to the back of the TV which means we had to install the pull away mount to have room to do that.  So NO flush mount - which I was really looking forward to.<br />-  The art.... very pretty.  You get to see ONE - You MUST sign up, with a credit card, for a 31 day free trial to see any others.  It also will not allow you add your own photos unless you sign up.  It costs $4.99 a month after the trial.  There are a lot of art options - but is it worth $4.99.  I am on the fence.  Because it doesn't ""look"" as I was lead to believe it would look like - a flush mounted frame.<br /><br />-  Overall, I am hugely disappointed.  The ads are very, very misleading.  You will find in the official description the mention of a ""mini box""... which the black box clearly is not - ""mini"" in anyway.<br />Also, you should know that if you purchase an adjustable wall mounting kit, you will likely need to alter it to fit.  We had to rig with TWO mounting sets to make it work - The arms were not long enough.  We also tried a larger kit but it showed beyond the edges of the frame even though the mounting kit was meant for a 32"" TV.  Eh.<br />For those that are curious - this TV is manufactured in Mexico.<br />I would recommend looking for something else - unless you're cool with the ugly black box, a monthly fee for art and a lot of cord dangle.  We did make the choice to keep it - for now.  The thought of trying to repack it was overwhelming.  And in all honesty, we had NO IDEA how much we were going to have to go through to make this work.  If we could have seen into the future, we would have taken the 3 hours to repack and return it.  Live and learn.  I really hope our experience can help others avoid our mistake!","Samsung QN32LS03TB 32"" The Frame Ultra High Definition Smart QLED Smart TV with a Samsung VG-SCFT32WT 32"" White Customizable Bezel For the Frame TV (2020)",1.0,1606669919698,AFZUK3MTBIBEDQOPAK3OATUOUKLA,B08BW4JTCG,0

There is a clear film on the outside/front - the back is a the self stick.  I was placing it on a painted, non textured wall - so it's very flat and the perfect material for this use.  A couple of things I learned as I was placing it... it worked best for me to cord up the holder before sticking to the wall - IMPORTANT - the sticky back is SOLID - NO repositioning at all. You want to make sure you have shoved up against the last one you placed as tightly as possible - you will still see the seam between each length - but less so if you carefully, firmly place each piece. Before removing the sticky back I ""placed"" it in position to see if I liked it and it would work.  Good thing, because once you remove the sticky back, it is NOT coming off without the sheet rock in torn pieces... just fyi.  I chose to position the opening part of the D tube facing up to make it easier to put another cord in or take one out... personal choice.  The ad says it is paintable and that is what I will try next.  Having said that, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful - and I am eager to see if this will stand the test of time and use.. meaning.. cords pulled, etc.  I see no reason why you couldn't use this going up a wall (thinking of TV that has been hung on wall, etc - personal taste - but remember, the sticky tape is solid and won't be removed without tearing/damaging paint.  As for textured surfaces - like wall texture, I am thinking that as positive as this sticky tape is, as long as it's not too textured, it should work - but to be honest, I have not tried it on a textured surface.  As with most things that use a form of sticky tape, the smoother the surface, the better it will stick.)  I hope this info was helpful to you!","D-Line Cord Cover 2-Pack, Cord Hiders, Cable Concealer, Cable Raceway, Wire Covers, Wall Mounted TV Wire Hider, Cable Management - 2X 1.18in W x 0.59in H x 39in Lengths (78in Total) - Wood-Effect",5.0,1568913785711,AFZUK3MTBIBEDQOPAK3OATUOUKLA,B07S8F43Y6,0

I did have dot in a bowl... so this an improvement.  :)  Dot sits all the way down into the owl.. you can see her if you are looking down (obviously) but when I am sitting in the living room where this dot is... the owl is above the area you can see into - it.

"So... I own both the tower and now several dots.  Of course the dots are more reasonably priced, however, the speaker ability is really where it's vastly different.  Obviously the tower is much better in the speaker department.  However, I did find that there is a cordless speaker you can buy to go with your 2nd gen dot that is an improvement and still at lower price point than the tower when combined with the cost of the dot. (Mokcao cordless speaker - amazon sells it too) Because the dots are so reasonably priced we have them in all 3 major rooms and use the cordless speaker to drop one dot in and take it outside to our sunroom when we like.  Over all, I am pleased with both my tower AND dots... but probably will stick to dot purchases in the future because of the price point.  I would say if you've been on the fence, the dot is well worth a try.  It's very easy to set up, you will need to download the app, also easy to follow step by step setups.

"Husband travels a LOT and had his very expensive ($530) backpack stolen in what the police called a &#34;bust and go&#34; (drove up next to the rental truck - took a hammer, busted out the window, grabbed his backpack and drove off - all within about 20 seconds - on security camera).

"I have owned many radar detectors.. they don't last forever, so I needed a replacement. It took a while for me to figure out how to turn down the volume (you need to push and HOLD the volume button when it is NOT alarming until it drops - but if you hold it down too long it goes up again. This is NOT explained in the instruction booklet)... but once I figured that out, it 's more pleasant. In my car, in order to give it a full view front and back, it has to be placed near the review view mirror..

"After a lifetime of working in and around industrial sites my husband is a bit hard of hearing. We are constantly battling over the sound of the TV... I can hear normally, so when he puts the sound at level he can hear the conversations, it feels like it is blasting our my ear drums!  We've had several sets of headphones... they are uncomfortable and he then can't hear me if I am asking him something...  so we decided to give this a try.  A couple of things... neither of are &#34;techies&#34; and were able to plug into our newer (less than 2 months old Samsung 65&#34; TV) in an instant.  So that was good.  If you turn it on it is an amazing sound upgrade from your TV sound system.  Very noticeable.  When you push the little conversation icon which is supposed to &#34;enhance&#34; the conversation portion of the sound, it is noticeable.  Perhaps not as dramatic, but it helps.  We are able to find a happy medium.  You are able to adjust the bass when you don't feel like having the &#34;theater&#34; experience.  It is a &#34;bar&#34; that sits just below our wall - hung TV.  It's about 30 or so inches long and about 3&#34; tall.  It does have the Bose logo right in the middle.  At first I wasn't thrilled about looking at it ... but I find I don't notice it now and it sort of helps to hide the cords - bonus.  As noted on other reviews... you do have to click on the &#34;conversation icon&#34; to &#34;enhance&#34; the conversation sound every single time you turn it on.  It would be nice if it just stayed on that position.  Also, it would NOT &#34;learn&#34; my new Samsung blue ray player or my TV... so the &#34;universal remote&#34; thing is not really happening.  The remote is very large and cumbersome for just turning on and off the sound bar...  I even researched the internet to be certain I had the right &#34;universal codes&#34; for my DVD player... Still didn't work.  So.... if you don't really care about adding just one more remote the sound quality is truly an upgrade from your TV. It really makes the sound match the quality of the picture I am seeing on my TV.  The conversation enhancement is noticeable, but maybe not as dramatic as you might hope - still - it's helpful.

"First, I do NOT receive compensation of ANY kind for my reviews...I purchased this detector for my sedan.  It is pretty large compared to my other detectors, but not terribly so.  I have provided some pics with a ruler so you can consider.  It came with an &#34;accessory&#34; kit... but honestly, it doesn't really need it as it comes with the cord and suction cup windshield attachment. It doesn't come with a lot of instructions, but it's pretty easy to figure out how settings work. I do find it nice to have a spare cord (in the accessory kit) - they don't last forever.  The cord comes with an easily reachable &#34;mute&#34; button.  Nice if your windshield is deep and therefore more inconvenient to reach.  Although, I usually keep my detectors on &#34;auto mute&#34; so after a few beeps it stops.It has a phone jack connector (see pic) which is different for me - but doesn't seem to effect it's use.  One of the nicest things I can say so far about this detector is that the screen is BRIGHT and inset.  So it is VERY easy to read when it's silent.  An important feature to me.  It also came with a lovely case.  I included a pic of the outside with measurements and an inside view of the case.  The suction cup windshield attachment has a very easy to use &#34;release&#34; button so you can leave the suction cups just were they need to be, collect the detector, place in it's case and take it with you.  In Arizona it gets super hot.  So even though I have a carport, I take my detector inside or with me 99% of the time if I will be longer than 30 minutes.  So far, it seems to do what a radar detector is meant to do, reminding me to take my foot off the gas pedal.

"I really like these...  the flat wires DO help them not to tangle... Has a &#34;universal&#34; tip as most things do this day and age... worked with my brand new LG G4 cell, my old rotary dial IPOD and my Kindle 8&#34; HDX.  It comes with 4 (2 sets) of extra ear cushions.  I feel that I have smallerish ears and I have a hard time finding earpods that are comfortable and will stay in.  These work great.  Comfortable and they have stayed in.  Mind you, I am NOT jogging with them in.  I only wish they'd come with a zipper case to hold them in for convenience.  At the price point, you'd think they would.  It does also have a microphone and I have &#34;tested&#34; that... worked. It has a little attachable pinch clip to keep in place as you move around. The foam tips are sort of like memory foam, but almost a bit softer really.  I think this both helps them stay in AND retain comfort.  The sound is very clean and clear - for an adult anyway.  The tips are cornflower blue if that matters to anyone... I think the pic is very clear and representative. I will update if there are any issues.<br />UPDATE: 6/29/2015 I have used these earbuds a number of times... one of the issues I have had in the past is that this &#34;shape&#34; of earbud doesn't want to stay in my ear... (tiny ears?) but these DO stay in.. I think it's the type of foam tip... seems to grip a bit better? To be fair, again, I am not jogging with them in... I am mostly in a sitting position using them. The &#34;flat&#34; wires really do help them not get all tangled... having stay that.. they also resist &#34;wrapping&#34; a bit too.  This is probably good. Otherwise you'd break the wires inside. The kiss of death to any wired accessory. Also, I've been informed that these are going to start coming with carry cases!!  Yup.

"I had the very first kindle...with a red leather first gen case.  I was really excited to get the new hdx 8.9&#34; kindle and a new red leather case.  These origami cases seem like a good idea.  But if you have them sitting on any kind of slightly slick surface or slightly inclined surface, it won't stand up. The function of the &#34;origami&#34; part is a little complicated, but the pictures help.  Initially it is it very stiff and hard to &#34;fold&#34;.  After a few uses it loosens up which makes setting up the &#34;standing&#34; position a little easier, but it still resists the action and as I mentioned, slips.  I was thinking a little rubber edge all around the case edge would help some.  The case &#34;attaches&#34; to the kindle via magnets and turns your kindle on automatically when you open the case, off when up close it.  On the up side, I definitely prefer the feel of the leather case as opposed to the plastic one.  Sadly neither case really functions as it should for standing. However it will provide some protection for the glass which is a pretty good size now.  In addition to the magnet set in, there is are outer power and volume buttons. They are in good locations and I have not hit them accidently. In fact those buttons are quite handy.<br />I just wish they'd put more thought into actual function and less into &#34;wow this looks cool&#34; on the stand part.<br />Hope this helps some.

"Try them. You will love them. Guaranteed.<br /><br />I've been using iCloths for several years now. They are the perfect phone screen cleaner, hands down!! I've tried other products from dry cloths, to alcohol rubs, to my t-shirt, nothing else comes close to clearning so thoroughly. One cloth is plenty!!<br /><br />They may see a little too dry to work when you are first using them. Don't worry. They are the perfect moistness.<br /><br />A trick. One side of the cloth is more rough than the other. Use the rough side to clear the phone screen. It works much better than the smoother side.<br /><br />I fold the cloth in half so there are two of these rough sides. I use one side to do the initial cleaning and the other side to do the final - perfection clean.<br /><br />Then, I fold the cloth inside out to clean off my finger tips before discarding the cloth.<br /><br />A suggestion - could you make a biodegradable wrapper?<br /><br />The price varies between 10 and 17 cents. Obviously, it's better when you get them for the lower price by buying a larger quantity.","iCloth Lens Cleaning Wipes [5 x 3.5 Inches - 100 Wipes] Safe for All Screens, Electronics & Glasses.

"We've had this TV a little more than 2 weeks. When the price dropped to $1997 on Amazon, I snapped it up. For the money, it is the best 4K TV out there. The smart controls work great, allowing you to use apps or browse the Internet on the TV, including side-by-side while you are watching TV. There's only a little 4k stuff out, mostly on Netflix - oceans, desserts, underwater world, etc. They are fantastic! Eventually, there will be more 4k. Haven't tried HDR yet. But, one of the reasons I got the TV was because it was one of ones that had HDR.<br /><br />I used rtings' (http://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/samsung/js8500/settings) calibration settings to sharpen the picture. Rtings really likes this TV: http://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/by-size/65-inch/best. It is their second best after the much pricier LG OLED. This review influenced my purchase.<br /><br />One of the main reason I got this TV was to watch movies. It is pretty much theater quality if you can sit within about 8 1/2 feet of the screen. You start to get the immersion effect when you are a little less the 9 feet away. The picture is still excellent from 10 feet, but you don't quite get the immersion effect. When the shots in the movie are bright, sunny and colorful, the view is spectacular - wow! When the shots are dark you see much more detail than I saw on my previous TV, which was a 2010 47&#34; 1080p LG. It was a good TV that I had professionally calibrated. But, it was no where near the quality of this TV: a 5-6 vs this one that's a 9-10.<br /><br />I thought about the Samsung JS9000, which is $1,000 more - pretty much just for the curved screen. Didn't think it was worth it. The LG OLED 65&#34; is better. Pretty much every review says so. But, it's priced at $4k, which is more than I wanted to spend.<br /><br />For sports, everything is really good. No judder that I've noticed. Daytime watching is plenty bright enough. Amazing picture, especially when the field is in full sunshine. I haven't watched a night football game yet.<br /><br />My wife says: &#34;It's awesome!&#34;.",Samsung UN65JS8500 65-Inch 4K Ultra HD 3D Smart LED TV (2015 Model),5.0,1449342431000,AEDNNPW6JQ4H6NPMF2FYMIUZOTGQ,B00U9U9GII,0
"Spent a lot of time looking for alternatives to the leather origami cases, which were just too expensive and had questionable functionality. So glad I found this this leather rooCase, which I have had long enough to be convinced it was the right choice, the best case out there in my view.<br /><br />The quality is superb and the price is very fair: real leather of good quality for only $38.<br /><br />A snap connects the inner leather sleeve / glove to the folding zipper case, which acts as a base and back so you can view the Kindle in portrait or landscape on almost any surface including an uneven bed -- even when your leaning nearby on the mattress makes the case slope slightly forward.<br /><br />There's plenty of air space around the sleeve along with openings for charging, on-off, volume control, and the speakers. Because of the good airflow, it runs 2-3 degrees centigrade cooler than when flat on a surface. My Kindle was getting too hot laying on my bed and had occasional freeze problems because of the heat. No more!!<br /><br />The case itself is made of high quality leather and has two zippers so you can zip from either side. I haven't used the case like a portfolio, but the inside compartments are well made and it would be very functional as a traveling case, offering protection and space for cards, etc. It isn't high style, but it's a handsome case.","Kindle Fire HDX 7 Case, roocase Executive Portfolio Fire HDX 7 2014 Leather Case Cover with Stand for Amazon Kindle Fire HDX 7 2014, BLACK (With Auto Wake / Sleep Cover)",5.0,1386698232000,AEDNNPW6JQ4H6NPMF2FYMIUZOTGQ,B00FF322AS,0

"I would have given this frame a 5- star rating because the menu is simple and the frame displays the pictures very well - crisp, sharp images. There is one flaw that I found frustrating. I loaded 20 pictures to test the frame prior to loading/reloading the final 46 pictures. (I used a USB flash drive attached to the frame for this purpose.)<br /><br />I notice that pictures I had previously deleted were showing on the screen. The menu did not show them as being imported into the actual frame memory... Couldn't figure out what the cause was. The good news is that the Micca website had a common question section that addressed this issue and informed me that the deleted pictures were in the recycle bin located on my jump drive.<br /><br />Huh? Never heard of that one. Followed their directions to right click my desktop recycle bin and click on the USB option and delete the files/recycle option. I did this and it worked beautifully. Reloaded my pictures onto the USB flash drive and place the drive into the frame. WA-LA - no more old deleted pictures playing.<br /><br />Gave it 3 stars because - if this is a common problem... they should fix their programming. Who ever heard of a recycle bin for a USB drive being loaded onto my desktop and creating a problem??? I shouldn't have to look this up to fix it.

"The concept of being able to see who is at your door is great, but the Ring Doorbell Pro is not great.  When installing the product, the wire connectors would not accept and lock the wires, I had to purchase different wire connectors.  For the first three days, I kept losing power to the doorbell.  I would have to reinstall it, the wires won't stay connected tightly to the doorbell no matter how tightly the screws are.  I had to put a large amount of electrical tape to keep the screws from loosening and power being lost.<br />After that the doorbell worked as it should for approximately 3 weeks, it then started getting knocked offline and needed to be reset continually.  If it was my wi-connection it would make sense that my other gadgets would also be losing their wi-fi connection, but that wasn't the case.  3 weeks ago my video view feed was black, no audio no picture.  I reinstalled the doorbell, but it was a black screen view.  I would get the notice that someone was at the door, but I could view them.  I contacted the Ring customer service.  After several days they replied, had me run some wi-fi diagnostics and send them screen shots.  They said I needed a Ring Pro Chime, because I needed a wi-fi extender.  If it worked okay at the first, why all of a sudden would it not work now?  No response was received back customer service.  I have not received the Ring Pro Chime as I was told I would to correct the problem.  I had an electrician check my power voltage where the doorbell is installed, he said I have the correct voltage according to their instructions.  As of today my doorbell is dead, it doesn't rind, video doesn't even pull up any longer.  This is not a good product and I would not recommend it to anyone.  It has been a waste of time and money.","Ring Video Doorbell Pro – Upgraded, with added security features and a sleek design (existing doorbell wiring required)",1.0,1496128174000,AH5OGXFCGV3OEA7H4NIZBQXGCOCA,B07G5ZG3Q4,0

"I replaced a large bulky router/modem combo from my ISP with this modem, as I already had a good router and didn't need two routers.  My ISP was charging roughly $10 a month for their equipment, which I will save now.  Of course the SB8200 is a little bit pricey, so it will take me about one and half years to recover my cost.  I was surprised how small this modem is; very compact and easy to find space for.  It generates a little heat, but has vent holes all over the outside and top for good ventilation.  Most of heat come out the top, but obviously you don't want to block any of the openings and make sure there is plenty of space above it.  I am getting great speed from the modem and had no issues with it at all.  My ISP was able to set it up remotely in about 30 minutes.  All the &#34;experts&#34; say it is best to have your own equipment, rather than rent from an ISP.  I like that idea, but the only problem is that if equipment fails, you are responsible for it, whereas if you rent from the ISP, they replace any defective equipment at no cost.  Also if you need an equipment upgrade, the ISP covers that too.  I don't expect to need an upgrade as this will handle the fastest speeds being offered now by my ISP (1 Gbps), although not yet in my area.  Right now I have 300 Mbps and the modem handles it nicely without any problem.  This modem does NOT use the Puma chipset, which was causing some issues.  This is a great<br />piece of equipment and suitable for home or business.  Just has 4 lights (power on, upload, download and connected to internet).  I thought I had seen comments about the lights being dim, but they are nice and bright; maybe bright enough to almost be distracting at times.  Am very happy so far with the modem and would buy one again if it lasts well over time.  There are a couple other modems by other quality manufacturers that are somewhat comparable to this one, but in side by side comparisons this seems to rate a little better.  The Arris brand was recommended to me and it is the brand used by my ISP.","ARRIS SURFboard SB8200 DOCSIS 3.1 Cable Modem | Approved for Comcast Xfinity, Cox, Charter Spectrum, & more | Two 1 Gbps Ports | 1 Gbps Max Internet Speeds | 4 OFDM Channels | 2 Year Warranty,White",5.0,1516488756708,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,B0BJGKZKV9,0

"This is a decent power amplifier.  I had an old large amp powering the external speakers from my television and that died.  This small amp fits much better in the spot where the big amp was, which was sitting on end to fit in available space.  The Lepy is small enough to fit just about anywhere.  A few problems with the Lepy.  First of all, there is only one input jack, which is the single plug 3.5 mm size.  Fortunately I had the proper audio cord, but regular RCA input jacks would be nice.  There are RCA output jacks for two speakers, as well as the &#34;pinch&#34; type speaker connectors.  With my old amp when I muted the TV, it also muted the amp.  Not sure how this worked, but muting the TV now does not mute the output to the Lepy.  Possibly because I had to use a different output jack from the TV, which may not mute external output.  The Lepy doesn't seem to work with the other output jacks that my old amp was plugged into.  You can mute or adjust the volume on the LEPY with the knobs or with a remote, but I don't want to get up and walk across the room to adjust the knobs.  The problem with the remote is that it appears to only have about a 10 foot range.  We want to control it from about a 12-15 foot distance, which just is not possible.  The remote doesn't seem to work past about 9 to 10 feet.  Possibly the battery on it is low, but since it was brand new, I doubt that.  The final problem is that there is really no instructions with the box, so you really have to play with it and guess what the various buttons do.  Also, what happens when you plug in an SD card or USB stick?  Does it automatically search for and play audio files?  There is no instructions on using those inputs.  The box does have a built-in FM radio, but I couldn't figure out how to easily tune it; it appears to be just up and down to find a station.  I wouldn't want to use it as an FM radio, as it appears that it is not able to get anything but the strongest stations.  An AM tuner would have been nice too.",Lepy LP-V9S Hi-Fi Stereo Power Digital Amplifier with USB SD DVD CD FM MP3,3.0,1443562668000,AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,B00L8O8WK2,0

"We have Apple products in our home, but none of us had Apple Watches.  I bought this for my college daughter who didn't ever really wear a watch.  She was so surprised and loves it and never takes it off!  And again, Apple didn't disappoint...set up was easy and usage is very intuitive.  I bought the black one for my husband for Christmas too, simply for the fall detection (seizures) and even at 60+, he found it easy to use.  They were so in love that the day after Christmas, I purchased one too and am really enjoying it.
